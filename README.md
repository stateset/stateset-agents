## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install & Run a Minimal Agent

```bash
# Install the framework
pip install stateset-agents

# (Optional) Install extras for training and API serving
# pip install "stateset-agents[dev,api,trl]"
```

```python
import asyncio
from stateset_agents import MultiTurnAgent
from stateset_agents.core.agent import AgentConfig

async def demo():
    # Create and initialize a small model for testing
    agent = MultiTurnAgent(AgentConfig(model_name="gpt2"))
    await agent.initialize()

    # Provide conversation history as a list of messages
    messages = [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, my order is delayed. What can you do?"}
    ]

    response = await agent.generate_response(messages)
    print(f"Agent: {response}")

asyncio.run(demo())
```

> 💡 Tip: Domain rewards (e.g., `create_domain_reward('customer_service')`) are used for training. See training examples below.

)
await agent.initialize()

messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I fix a memory leak in my Python app?"}]
response = await agent.generate_response(messages)
```

### 📈 Sales Intelligence
**Qualify leads and summarize insights**

```python
from stateset_agents import MultiTurnAgent
from stateset_agents.core.agent import AgentConfig
