## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install & Train Your First Agent in 5 Minutes

```bash
# Install the framework
pip install stateset-agents

# Create your first agent
python -c "
import asyncio
from stateset_agents import MultiTurnAgent, create_domain_reward

async def demo():
    # Create customer service agent
    reward = create_domain_reward('customer_service')
    agent = MultiTurnAgent(reward_function=reward)
    
    # Start a conversation
    response = await agent.generate_response(
        'Hi, my order is delayed. What can you do?'
    )
    print(f'Agent: {response}')

asyncio.run(demo())
"
```

### 💬 Customer Service Automation
**Handle complex customer interactions with domain-specific intelligence**

```python
from stateset_agents import MultiTurnAgent, create_domain_reward

# Domain-aware customer service agent
reward = create_domain_reward("customer_service")
agent = MultiTurnAgent(reward_function=reward)

response = await agent.generate_response(
    "My order is delayed and I need a refund",
    context={"order_status": "delayed", "customer_value": "high"}
)
```

### 🔧 Technical Support Assistant
**Debug code and provide expert assistance**

```python
from stateset_agents import ToolAgent

# Agent with technical capabilities
agent = ToolAgent(tools=["code_analyzer", "documentation_search"])

response = await agent.handle_query(
    "How do I fix a memory leak in my Python app?",
    tools_enabled=True
)
```

### 📈 Sales Intelligence
**Qualify leads and close deals with AI assistance**

```python
# Sales-focused agent with lead scoring
agent = MultiTurnAgent(strategy="sales_qualification")

insights = await agent.analyze_lead(
    customer_profile, 
    product_catalog,
    sales_goals={"monthly_target": 100000}
)
```

### 🎓 Adaptive Learning
**Personalized education with real-time adaptation**

```python
# Educational agent with adaptive learning
agent = MultiTurnAgent(learning_profile="adaptive")

lesson = await agent.teach_concept(
    topic="machine_learning",
    student_level="intermediate",
    learning_style="hands_on"
)
